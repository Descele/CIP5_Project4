Canvas: Geometric print

Stanford Universityâ€™s Code in Placeâ€”a global initiative inspired by CS 106Aâ€”equipped me with rigorous Python foundations through project-based learning. These projects reflect how I bridge code and urban analysis, transforming abstract concepts into tools for spatial problem-solving.

As an urban planner, I designed solutions that demonstrate Pythonâ€™s versatility: automating workflows, analyzing datasets, and visualizing urban data patterns. Each project here began as a technical exercise but evolved into a lens for interdisciplinary thinking.

## ðŸŽ¨ Geometric Pattern Generator  
*I created this vibrant Python art generator that produces a 600x600px rainbow grid. Using alternating rectangles and ovals in a 6x6 layout, each nested shape reveals a smaller white counterpartâ€”creating mesmerizing contrast. This project demonstrates how simple graphical programming (via `graphics.py`) can transform basic shapes and color sequences into striking visual patterns.*

**Key Features**:  
- Rainbow color sequencing  
- Nested shape contrast (rectangle â†’ oval â†’ rectangle)  
- Clean grid-based layout
